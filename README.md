## Bayesian methods of hyperparameter optimization
In addition to the random search and the grid search methods for selecting optimal hyperparameters, we can use Bayesian methods of probabilities to select the optimal hyperparameters for an algorithm.

In this case study, we will be using the BayesianOptimization library to perform hyperparmater tuning. This library has very good documentation which you can find here: https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization

You will need to install the Bayesian optimization module. Running a cell with an exclamation point in the beginning of the command will run it as a shell command — please do this to install this module from our notebook in the cell below.
